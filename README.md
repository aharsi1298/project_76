# project_76

My normal projects repository would be flooded with files which could not be uploaded to a folder instead, so I had to create a new repository. Also this is a *[Google Flutter](https://flutter.dev)* project which had approximately 1,564 files, which could be uploaded at once, so I'm uploading the essential ones: source code, a few miscellaneous files and the output.
